# Macaw's ToDo

Simple Vim copycat developed in C :PP

## 📝 LIST:

- refactor buffer:
  - insert/remove between lines allocated more than needed, resulting in unitialized chars
  - delete char + x keybind in NORMAL mode

## MAYBE ???

- treesitter... I'm going to have an hard time with this :PP
- undo/redo system... this too
- save current line pos in a new variable instead of cursor y
